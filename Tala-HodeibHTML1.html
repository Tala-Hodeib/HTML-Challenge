        <h3>Havok</h3>
        <p> Alexander Summers was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
            He is the second of the three known sons of Christopher Summers, 
            a United States Air Force Major and test pilot, 
            and his wife Katherine Anne. When Alex was a boy growing up in Anchorage, Alaska, United States,
             his father took the family for a flight in their airplane, 
             which came under attack by a Shi'ar spaceship.
            As the plane caught fire and was crashing, his parents fastened Alex 
            and his brother Scott into a parachute and pushed them off the plane
            in hopes that they would survive.
             His brother hit his head and was in a coma for a short while.
             The Summers boys were recovered and put into an orphanage 
             and Alex was soon adopted though Scott remained there for much of his childhood. 
             Alex was raised by the Blandings whose son Todd had died in a car accident.
             They tried to make Alex fit into the image of their son, and he tried to do as best he could. 
             When the boy responsible for Todd's death kidnapped Alex and his foster sister, Haley, 
             Alex manifested his powers for the first time, incinerating the boy. 
             <q>Mister Sinister</q>, an evil geneticist who was obsessed with the Summers bloodline, 
             appeared eager yet surprised that Alex's potential exceeded 
             Scott's â€“ despite the fact that he seemed to lack control over his gift. 
             Sinister placed psi-blocks on both Alex and Haley's minds, c
             ausing them to forget what had happened that night.</p>
